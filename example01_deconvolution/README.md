# pyphret - anisoplanatic deconvolution

To run the scripts, you need to first clone the pyphret repository and then add it to your pythonpath manager.

The demos assume you have a quite good nVIDIA GPU and the pytorch library properly installed. 
Using it on a CPU can slow down dramatically the process.
